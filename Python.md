### **Projects**  

#### **Full Stack Application – MovieRating Website**  
Built a **movie rating and review platform** that enables users to browse movies, filter content by genre, and view detailed information. The frontend, developed using **React.js** and styled with CSS, provides an intuitive and engaging user experience. The backend, powered by **FastAPI**, fetches movie data dynamically from third-party APIs. **Redux** is integrated for efficient state management, ensuring smooth and responsive UI interactions. To enhance security, **JWT authentication** is implemented, allowing users to log in securely. The application is deployed with the **backend running on AWS EC2** and the **frontend hosted on Vercel/Netlify**, ensuring scalability and high availability.  

#### **Cloud Project – AWS Automation with boto3**  
Designed and implemented an **automated cloud resource management system** using **boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)**. This project focuses on automating **EC2 instance provisioning** and **S3 bucket management**, streamlining cloud operations. **IAM role-based security** is incorporated to manage AWS credentials securely, preventing unauthorized access. The system allows users to dynamically configure cloud resources via API calls, making cloud infrastructure management efficient and seamless. Additionally, **logging and monitoring** mechanisms are integrated to track resource usage, ensuring optimal scalability and cost efficiency.  

#### **Gen AI – Advanced ATS Scanner**  
Developed an **AI-powered ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scanner** that enhances resume screening using **OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0**. This system intelligently loads resumes, scans content, and evaluates candidate profiles by comparing **skills and project descriptions with job postings**. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is implemented to improve the accuracy of resume-to-job matching, ensuring a more precise and efficient shortlisting process. The backend, built with **FastAPI**, processes resume data efficiently, while **VectorDB (Pinecone) is utilized for structured storage and retrieval of candidate profiles**. A user-friendly dashboard allows recruiters to upload resumes and view ranked candidates based on their compatibility scores.
